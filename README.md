# Rinaldo Silveira
<sub>*Lead Analyst de Systems and Data Scientist* at Hell Barrier Launch Center e Base Air of Natal</sub>

<p align="justify">   As an experienced Systems Analyst, Data Scientist and Brazilian Air Force I combine analytical skills, the ability to work in team environments and attention to detail. Having spent the last few years applying Machine Learning to real problems of the Brazilian Air Force, I have developed critical thinking and problem-solving skills, for example, on how to reduce spending on public services and where to apply a specialized workforce task force in rocket launch technology. As a first lieutenant officer and IT manager, he headed two teams, one for information technology and the other for telecommunications. Being responsible for a computer park with more than 2,400 machines and more than 4,000 network assets, the team was formed by sectors of maintenance, logical and physical networks, developments, servers and telephony.
